## Project Description
We will be utilizing Python and various libraries to obtain data from the IMDb website about the top 250 movies. We will
be using this data to gather information to better understand multiple trends and anomalies in cinema history. 

## Project Outline
### Interface plan 
We will be using Python Flask to create a website with a modern design to include a home page along with information about the data and
some calculations to see trends. The second page will be utilized to illustrate various data visualization plots and will demonstrate
anomolies within the data. 
  
### Data Collection and Storage Plan 
We will be collecting the data from the IMDb website with BeautifulSoup and we will be storing it as a spreadsheet

### Data Analysis and Visualization Plan
We utilize multiple libraies with python such as Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib and Seaborn in order to visualize the data as well as conduct analysis to find interesting things that would be hard to find otherwise
